## Priority Actions

### 1. Scope down the IAM policy to restrict access to only the specific Bedrock Data Automation resources needed by this project. Replace the wildcard resource with specific ARN patterns for the project resources being created.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-001  
**Business Impact:** Unauthorized access to or manipulation of all Bedrock Data Automation projects in the account, potentially leading to data exposure or service disruption.

### 2. Implement CloudTrail data events for Bedrock API calls, configure CloudWatch Logs for detailed Lambda execution logs, and consider implementing custom logging for critical operations that captures who, what, when, and how resources are being accessed or modified.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-002  
**Business Impact:** Inability to effectively monitor, audit, or investigate security incidents related to Bedrock Data Automation operations.

### 2. Add IAM condition keys to the policy to restrict access based on source IP, require MFA for sensitive operations, implement time-based constraints, and add aws:PrincipalArn conditions to limit which entities can assume the role.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-006  
**Business Impact:** Increased blast radius of compromised credentials with no additional security layers beyond the credentials themselves.

### 3. Deploy the Lambda function within a VPC and use VPC endpoints for AWS services to ensure traffic remains within the AWS network. Configure appropriate security groups to restrict access.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-003  
**Business Impact:** Potential exposure of sensitive information in transit, including any data exchanged with Bedrock services.

### 3. Implement strong input validation in the BDAProjectLambda handler function to verify all parameters meet expected formats and constraints before passing them to AWS APIs.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-005  
**Business Impact:** Potential manipulation of Bedrock Data Automation resources or injection attacks through malicious input parameters.

**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-004  
**Business Impact:** Potential service disruption or unexpected AWS billing charges due to unbounded Lambda function execution.

### 4. Implement proper versioning for blueprints and project configurations. Use AWS tags to track metadata about resources including creation date, owner, and purpose. Consider implementing a change management process for blueprint updates.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-007  
**Business Impact:** Inability to track who made changes to blueprints or project configurations, or to roll back to previous stable versions after undesired changes.



## Detailed Threat Analysis

## High Severity Threats

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-001: Overly Permissive Bedrock Data Automation Access

**STRIDE Category:** Elevation of Privilege  
**Affected Resource:** `LambdaExecutionRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-272

#### Issue
The IAM policy grants wildcard (*) resource access for multiple Bedrock Data Automation actions, allowing the role to access all BDA resources within the account rather than limiting access to specific project resources.

#### Attack Vector
If the Lambda function is compromised, an attacker could manipulate any Bedrock Data Automation project in the account, potentially accessing sensitive data or disrupting other projects.

#### Potential Impact
Unauthorized access to or manipulation of all Bedrock Data Automation projects in the account, potentially leading to data exposure or service disruption.

#### Remediation
Scope down the IAM policy to restrict access to only the specific Bedrock Data Automation resources needed by this project. Replace the wildcard resource with specific ARN patterns for the project resources being created.

## Medium Severity Threats

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-002: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProjectLambda` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
While the Lambda function has a configurable LOG_LEVEL parameter, there are no explicit audit trails or monitoring for the Bedrock Data Automation operations performed by the Lambda function.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker who gains access could perform unauthorized actions on Bedrock Data Automation resources without detection or attribution.

#### Potential Impact
Inability to effectively monitor, audit, or investigate security incidents related to Bedrock Data Automation operations.

#### Remediation
Implement CloudTrail data events for Bedrock API calls, configure CloudWatch Logs for detailed Lambda execution logs, and consider implementing custom logging for critical operations that captures who, what, when, and how resources are being accessed or modified.

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-003: Lambda Function Lacks VPC Integration

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProjectLambda` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-319

#### Issue
The BDAProjectLambda function is explicitly configured to avoid VPC deployment as noted in the cfn_nag suppression, which means it operates directly on the public AWS API endpoint rather than through VPC endpoints.

#### Attack Vector
Network traffic between the Lambda function and AWS services traverses the public internet, potentially exposing API calls and sensitive data to network monitoring or interception.

#### Potential Impact
Potential exposure of sensitive information in transit, including any data exchanged with Bedrock services.

#### Remediation
Deploy the Lambda function within a VPC and use VPC endpoints for AWS services to ensure traffic remains within the AWS network. Configure appropriate security groups to restrict access.

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-005: No Data Validation for Custom Resource Properties

**STRIDE Category:** Tampering  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProject` (Custom::BDAProject)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-20

#### Issue
The BDAProject custom resource doesn't appear to have input validation for project properties like BlueprintNames, which are provided as parameters to the Bedrock API calls.

#### Attack Vector
If an attacker can influence these parameters (through CloudFormation stack updates), they could potentially inject malicious values or perform injection attacks against the Bedrock API.

#### Potential Impact
Potential manipulation of Bedrock Data Automation resources or injection attacks through malicious input parameters.

#### Remediation
Implement strong input validation in the BDAProjectLambda handler function to verify all parameters meet expected formats and constraints before passing them to AWS APIs.

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-006: Missing Condition Keys in IAM Policies

**STRIDE Category:** Elevation of Privilege  
**Affected Resource:** `LambdaExecutionRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-272

#### Issue
The IAM policy for LambdaExecutionRole grants broad Bedrock permissions without conditional constraints such as source IP restrictions, time-of-day limitations, or MFA requirements.

#### Attack Vector
If the Lambda function is compromised or credentials are leaked, an attacker could use the permissions from any location without additional verification requirements.

#### Potential Impact
Increased blast radius of compromised credentials with no additional security layers beyond the credentials themselves.

#### Remediation
Add IAM condition keys to the policy to restrict access based on source IP, require MFA for sensitive operations, implement time-based constraints, and add aws:PrincipalArn conditions to limit which entities can assume the role.

## Low Severity Threats

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-004: Missing Concurrency Limits on Lambda Function

**STRIDE Category:** Denial of Service  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProjectLambda` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-770

#### Issue
The Lambda function has explicitly suppressed the W92 cfn_nag warning for missing concurrency limits, which could allow unbounded scaling during high traffic or in a DoS scenario.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker could trigger many simultaneous invocations of the function, potentially causing resource exhaustion or high costs.

#### Potential Impact
Potential service disruption or unexpected AWS billing charges due to unbounded Lambda function execution.

#### Remediation
Implement reserved concurrency limits on the Lambda function to cap the maximum number of concurrent executions and prevent excessive resource consumption.

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-007: Missing Version Control for Blueprint Changes

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProject` (Custom::BDAProject)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
The template includes a hardcoded Version parameter ('04-04-2025') but doesn't implement proper versioning for blueprints or project configurations, making it difficult to track or roll back changes.

#### Attack Vector
Malicious changes to blueprints or configurations could be difficult to detect or attribute without proper versioning and change tracking.

#### Potential Impact
Inability to track who made changes to blueprints or project configurations, or to roll back to previous stable versions after undesired changes.

#### Remediation
Implement proper versioning for blueprints and project configurations. Use AWS tags to track metadata about resources including creation date, owner, and purpose. Consider implementing a change management process for blueprint updates.
