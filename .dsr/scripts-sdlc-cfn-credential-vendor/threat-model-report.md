**Template:** `threat-model.md`  
**Analysis Date:** 2025-08-19_17-07-16  
**Generated By:** CloudFormation Threat Modeling Tool  

## Executive Summary

This threat model analysis identified **6** security threats. The analysis reveals **0** critical, **0** high, **4** medium, and **2** low severity findings.

## Priority Actions

### 2. Add condition keys to the S3 PutObject policy requiring server-side encryption and object integrity checking. Consider also implementing versioning on the S3 bucket to track changes and enable rollbacks.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** GITLAB-ROLE-AND-PERMISSIONS-THREAT-001  
**Business Impact:** Unauthorized code deployment could lead to infrastructure compromise, data breaches, or service disruption.

### 2. Consider implementing additional conditions in the trust policy, such as requiring specific source IP ranges, adding an external ID requirement, or implementing a multi-factor authentication requirement for sensitive operations.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** GITLAB-ROLE-AND-PERMISSIONS-THREAT-003  
**Business Impact:** Unauthorized access to AWS resources including the ability to deploy code and access pipeline information.

### 2. Implement S3 Object Lock, versioning, and require integrity checking via checksums. Consider adding a code scanning or validation step in the pipeline before deployment.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GITLAB-ROLE-AND-PERMISSIONS-THREAT-006  
**Business Impact:** Execution of unauthorized or malicious code in the AWS environment, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.

### 3. Implement CloudTrail logging specifically for actions performed by this role. Consider adding a policy to prevent actions that would disable or modify logging configurations. Additionally, implement CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activities.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GITLAB-ROLE-AND-PERMISSIONS-THREAT-002  
**Business Impact:** Reduced ability to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents involving the GitLab integration.

### 4. Scope down the CloudWatch Logs permissions to specific log groups related to the GitLab integration's CodeBuild and CodePipeline resources rather than allowing access to all log groups in the account.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** GITLAB-ROLE-AND-PERMISSIONS-THREAT-004  
**Business Impact:** Potential exposure of sensitive information from logs of unrelated services or applications.

### 4. Scope the ListPipelines permission to specific pipelines related to the GitLab project, or consider removing it if not absolutely necessary for the integration's functionality.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** GITLAB-ROLE-AND-PERMISSIONS-THREAT-005  
**Business Impact:** Increased attack surface through information leakage about CI/CD processes and infrastructure deployment patterns.



## Detailed Threat Analysis

## Medium Severity Threats

### GITLAB-ROLE-AND-PERMISSIONS-THREAT-001: Overly Permissive S3 Resource Definition

**STRIDE Category:** Elevation of Privilege  
**Affected Resource:** `GitLabRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-284

#### Issue
The S3 PutObject permission is limited to a specific object path, but doesn't include any condition keys for object-level encryption or verification, which could allow unauthorized modifications to the deployment code.

#### Attack Vector
If a malicious actor gains access to the GitLab role credentials, they could replace the deployment code with malicious code without requiring encryption or integrity validation.

#### Potential Impact
Unauthorized code deployment could lead to infrastructure compromise, data breaches, or service disruption.

#### Remediation
Add condition keys to the S3 PutObject policy requiring server-side encryption and object integrity checking. Consider also implementing versioning on the S3 bucket to track changes and enable rollbacks.

### GITLAB-ROLE-AND-PERMISSIONS-THREAT-002: Insufficient Logging for GitLab Role Actions

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `GitLabRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
The template doesn't include permissions or configurations for comprehensive logging of actions performed by the GitLab role, limiting accountability and audit capabilities.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker using compromised credentials could perform malicious actions that might go undetected or be difficult to attribute to a specific actor.

#### Potential Impact
Reduced ability to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents involving the GitLab integration.

#### Remediation
Implement CloudTrail logging specifically for actions performed by this role. Consider adding a policy to prevent actions that would disable or modify logging configurations. Additionally, implement CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activities.

### GITLAB-ROLE-AND-PERMISSIONS-THREAT-003: Potential for Cross-Account Role Assumption Abuse

**STRIDE Category:** Spoofing  
**Affected Resource:** `GitLabRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-306

#### Issue
The role trust policy relies primarily on GitLab Group and Project tags for authorization. While this provides some protection, additional safeguards could strengthen the authentication mechanism.

#### Attack Vector
If the trusted external account (979517299116) is compromised, attackers might be able to forge or manipulate the required tags to assume this role.

#### Potential Impact
Unauthorized access to AWS resources including the ability to deploy code and access pipeline information.

#### Remediation
Consider implementing additional conditions in the trust policy, such as requiring specific source IP ranges, adding an external ID requirement, or implementing a multi-factor authentication requirement for sensitive operations.

### GITLAB-ROLE-AND-PERMISSIONS-THREAT-006: No Integrity Verification for Deployed Code

**STRIDE Category:** Tampering  
**Affected Resource:** `GitLabRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-345

#### Issue
The CloudFormation template doesn't implement any integrity checking mechanisms for the code being deployed via S3, allowing potentially tampered code to be introduced into the pipeline.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker who compromises the GitLab system could upload malicious code that would be automatically processed by downstream systems without integrity verification.

#### Potential Impact
Execution of unauthorized or malicious code in the AWS environment, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.

#### Remediation
Implement S3 Object Lock, versioning, and require integrity checking via checksums. Consider adding a code scanning or validation step in the pipeline before deployment.

## Low Severity Threats

### GITLAB-ROLE-AND-PERMISSIONS-THREAT-004: Broad CloudWatch Logs Access

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `GitLabRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-200

#### Issue
The policy allows access to describe log groups and streams and get log events for all CloudWatch logs in the account, which could expose sensitive information beyond what's needed for pipeline monitoring.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker with access to this role could view log data from various services across the AWS account, potentially exposing sensitive information or application secrets logged by other systems.

#### Potential Impact
Potential exposure of sensitive information from logs of unrelated services or applications.

#### Remediation
Scope down the CloudWatch Logs permissions to specific log groups related to the GitLab integration's CodeBuild and CodePipeline resources rather than allowing access to all log groups in the account.

**References:**
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/iam-access-control-overview-for-logs.html

### GITLAB-ROLE-AND-PERMISSIONS-THREAT-005: Overly Broad CodePipeline List Permissions

**STRIDE Category:** Elevation of Privilege  
**Affected Resource:** `GitLabRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-272

#### Issue
The role has permission to list all pipelines in the account, beyond what might be necessary for the specific GitLab integration.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker with access to the role could enumerate all pipelines in the account, potentially gathering information about deployment patterns and infrastructure that could be used for further attacks.

#### Potential Impact
Increased attack surface through information leakage about CI/CD processes and infrastructure deployment patterns.

#### Remediation
Scope the ListPipelines permission to specific pipelines related to the GitLab project, or consider removing it if not absolutely necessary for the integration's functionality.
