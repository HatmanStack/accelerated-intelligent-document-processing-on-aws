## Detailed Threat Analysis

## High Severity Threats

### SDLC-ROLE-THREAT-001: Overly Permissive IAM Permissions

**STRIDE Category:** Elevation of Privilege  
**Affected Resource:** `LimitedIAMAccessPolicy` (AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-272

#### Issue
The LimitedIAMAccessPolicy grants broad IAM permissions with wildcard resources (*), allowing actions that can be used to escalate privileges or create backdoor access paths.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker who compromises the BuilderRole could create or modify IAM entities with elevated permissions, attach policies to users/groups/roles, or create service-linked roles that persist after the initial compromise.

#### Potential Impact
Complete account compromise, persistent backdoors, and ability to bypass existing security controls and detection mechanisms.

#### Remediation
1. Scope down IAM permissions to specific resources using ARN patterns instead of wildcard resources.
2. Implement condition keys to restrict permissions (e.g., aws:PrincipalArn, aws:SourceIp).
3. Remove high-risk permissions like IAM user management that aren't needed for SDLC activities.
4. Consider using AWS permission boundaries to limit maximum permissions.

### SDLC-ROLE-THREAT-002: Excessive Service Principals in Trust Policy

**STRIDE Category:** Spoofing  
**Affected Resource:** `BuilderRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-284

#### Issue
The BuilderRole trust policy allows multiple service principals (ec2, codebuild, cloudformation) to assume the role without conditions, increasing the attack surface for role assumption.

#### Attack Vector
If any of these services are compromised or misconfigured, an attacker could assume the BuilderRole, gaining extensive permissions provided by PowerUserAccess and the LimitedIAMAccessPolicy.

#### Potential Impact
Unauthorized access to AWS resources with powerful permissions, allowing potential data exfiltration, resource manipulation, or further privilege escalation.

#### Remediation
1. Apply strict conditions in the trust policy using aws:SourceArn and aws:SourceAccount.
2. Separate roles by service for granular permission control.
3. Use externalId requirements where applicable.
4. Regularly audit and rotate credentials.

### SDLC-ROLE-THREAT-003: PowerUserAccess Combined with IAM Permissions

**STRIDE Category:** Elevation of Privilege  
**Affected Resource:** `BuilderRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-269

#### Issue
The BuilderRole combines PowerUserAccess with extensive IAM permissions, creating a role that has near-administrative capabilities without proper isolation or guardrails.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker who gains access to this role could leverage the combined permissions to create persistent access, modify security controls, and access sensitive data across multiple AWS services.

#### Potential Impact
Potential for complete account takeover, data breaches, and deployment of malicious resources that could affect production environments.

#### Remediation
1. Replace PowerUserAccess with more granular, service-specific policies.
2. Implement permission boundaries to restrict maximum permissions.
3. Create separate roles for different SDLC stages with decreasing privilege levels.
4. Implement just-in-time access with temporary credential issuance.

## Medium Severity Threats

### SDLC-ROLE-THREAT-004: Missing Logging and Monitoring Requirements

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `BuilderRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
The template does not include or enforce requirements for CloudTrail, CloudWatch, or other logging and monitoring mechanisms for tracking actions performed by the BuilderRole.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker who compromises this role could perform malicious actions without being detected, making incident investigation difficult or impossible.

#### Potential Impact
Inability to detect security incidents, account compromise, or policy violations in a timely manner, and challenges in forensic investigation after a security incident.

#### Remediation
1. Ensure CloudTrail is enabled with multi-region logging and log file validation.
2. Set up CloudWatch alarms for critical IAM actions.
3. Configure AWS Config to monitor policy changes.
4. Consider integrating with Security Hub and GuardDuty.

### SDLC-ROLE-THREAT-005: Role Allows Self-Modification

**STRIDE Category:** Tampering  
**Affected Resource:** `BuilderRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-281

#### Issue
The BuilderRole permissions allow for modification of IAM policies and roles, potentially including itself, which could be used to expand permissions beyond intended scope.

#### Attack Vector
An authorized user or compromised process could modify the role to grant additional permissions, remove restrictions, or create backdoor access paths.

#### Potential Impact
Security controls could be subverted, leading to privilege escalation, persistent unauthorized access, or removal of security guardrails.

#### Remediation
1. Implement a separate admin role for IAM management functions.
2. Use SCPs to prevent modification of security-critical roles and policies.
3. Implement strong detective controls for IAM policy changes.
4. Apply conditions to prevent self-modification of roles.

### SDLC-ROLE-THREAT-006: Missing Resource Access Controls

**STRIDE Category:** Denial of Service  
**Affected Resource:** `LimitedIAMAccessPolicy` (AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-732

#### Issue
The policy grants delete permissions for critical IAM resources without resource-specific constraints, which could lead to accidental or malicious removal of essential roles or policies.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker or misconfigured automation tool could delete critical IAM roles, instance profiles, or policies, disrupting application services and CI/CD workflows.

#### Potential Impact
Service disruption, broken deployments, authentication failures, and significant operational downtime while IAM resources are recreated.

#### Remediation
1. Implement resource-specific ARNs in policy statements.
2. Add condition keys to protect critical resources.
3. Consider implementing resource tagging strategies and tag-based conditions.
4. Create separate policies for creation vs. deletion operations.

### SDLC-ROLE-THREAT-007: Excessive List and Get Permissions

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `LimitedIAMAccessPolicy` (AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-200

#### Issue
The policy grants broad list and get permissions (iam:List*, iam:Get*) across all IAM resources, which could expose sensitive IAM configuration information.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker with access to the role could enumerate all IAM users, roles, policies, and their relationships to map the security posture and identify privilege escalation paths.

#### Potential Impact
Exposure of security configuration and potential targeting of specific IAM entities for further attacks, including social engineering or targeted privilege escalation.

#### Remediation
1. Limit list and get permissions to only necessary resources.
2. Implement condition keys to restrict when these permissions can be used.
3. Consider implementing session policies for temporary access.
