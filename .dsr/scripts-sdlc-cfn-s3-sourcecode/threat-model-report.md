# CloudFormation Threat Model Report

**Template:** `threat-model.md`  
**Analysis Date:** 2025-08-19_17-07-04  
**Generated By:** CloudFormation Threat Modeling Tool  

## Executive Summary

This threat model analysis identified **5** security threats. The analysis reveals **0** critical, **0** high, **3** medium, and **2** low severity findings.

## Priority Actions

### 2. Enable server access logging on the S3 bucket and direct logs to a secure, dedicated logging bucket.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** S3_BUCKET_FOR_INITIAL_DEPLOYMENT-THREAT-002  
**Business Impact:** Inability to detect or investigate unauthorized access to deployment artifacts.

### 2. Implement a restrictive bucket policy that explicitly limits access to only the required IAM roles or principals needed for the deployment process.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** S3_BUCKET_FOR_INITIAL_DEPLOYMENT-THREAT-003  
**Business Impact:** Potential unauthorized access to deployment code which may contain sensitive information such as configuration details or security implementations.

### 2. Remove default values that contain placeholder text and ensure that parameters are explicitly provided during stack creation with appropriate values.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** S3_BUCKET_FOR_INITIAL_DEPLOYMENT-THREAT-005  
**Business Impact:** Predictable resource names may make it easier for attackers to identify and target specific resources in your environment.

### 3. Implement a lifecycle policy on the bucket to automatically expire and delete objects after they are no longer needed for deployment.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** S3_BUCKET_FOR_INITIAL_DEPLOYMENT-THREAT-001  
**Business Impact:** Storage of unnecessary data increases costs and potential exposure of outdated artifacts with security vulnerabilities.

### 3. Consider implementing S3 Object Lock in compliance mode to prevent modification of deployment artifacts once they've been uploaded and validated.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** S3_BUCKET_FOR_INITIAL_DEPLOYMENT-THREAT-004  
**Business Impact:** Could allow injection of unauthorized changes into deployment packages, leading to deployment of compromised resources.



## Detailed Threat Analysis

## Medium Severity Threats

### S3_BUCKET_FOR_INITIAL_DEPLOYMENT-THREAT-002: Missing access logging configuration

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `InitialInstallBucket` (AWS::S3::Bucket)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
The S3 bucket does not have access logging enabled, which hinders audit capabilities and makes it difficult to track who accessed deployment artifacts.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker who gains access to the bucket could exfiltrate sensitive deployment code without leaving an audit trail.

#### Potential Impact
Inability to detect or investigate unauthorized access to deployment artifacts.

#### Remediation
Enable server access logging on the S3 bucket and direct logs to a secure, dedicated logging bucket.

### S3_BUCKET_FOR_INITIAL_DEPLOYMENT-THREAT-003: No resource policy restricting access to the S3 bucket

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `InitialInstallBucket` (AWS::S3::Bucket)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-732

#### Issue
The S3 bucket lacks a bucket policy to explicitly restrict access, relying solely on default permissions which could allow broad access within the AWS account.

#### Attack Vector
Any principal with S3 permissions in the AWS account could potentially access sensitive deployment artifacts.

#### Potential Impact
Potential unauthorized access to deployment code which may contain sensitive information such as configuration details or security implementations.

#### Remediation
Implement a restrictive bucket policy that explicitly limits access to only the required IAM roles or principals needed for the deployment process.

### S3_BUCKET_FOR_INITIAL_DEPLOYMENT-THREAT-005: Default parameter value contains placeholder text

**STRIDE Category:** Elevation of Privilege  
**Affected Resource:** `InitialInstallBucket` (AWS::S3::Bucket)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-798

#### Issue
The default bucket name parameter contains placeholder text ('YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT-YOUR_REGION') which could lead to insecure implementations if not properly replaced during deployment.

#### Attack Vector
If deployments occur without proper parameter values, buckets could be created with predictable naming conventions that make them easier to target.

#### Potential Impact
Predictable resource names may make it easier for attackers to identify and target specific resources in your environment.

#### Remediation
Remove default values that contain placeholder text and ensure that parameters are explicitly provided during stack creation with appropriate values.

## Low Severity Threats

### S3_BUCKET_FOR_INITIAL_DEPLOYMENT-THREAT-001: Missing lifecycle configuration for deployment bucket

**STRIDE Category:** Tampering  
**Affected Resource:** `InitialInstallBucket` (AWS::S3::Bucket)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-693

#### Issue
The S3 bucket does not have a lifecycle configuration defined, which could lead to indefinite retention of temporary deployment artifacts and unnecessary storage costs.

#### Attack Vector
While not directly exploitable, the accumulation of old deployment artifacts increases the attack surface over time as outdated code may contain known vulnerabilities.

#### Potential Impact
Storage of unnecessary data increases costs and potential exposure of outdated artifacts with security vulnerabilities.

#### Remediation
Implement a lifecycle policy on the bucket to automatically expire and delete objects after they are no longer needed for deployment.

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html

---

### S3_BUCKET_FOR_INITIAL_DEPLOYMENT-THREAT-004: Missing S3 object lock configuration

**STRIDE Category:** Tampering  
**Affected Resource:** `InitialInstallBucket` (AWS::S3::Bucket)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-642

#### Issue
The deployment bucket does not implement S3 Object Lock, which could allow the modification or deletion of critical deployment artifacts by authorized users.

#### Attack Vector
A compromised account with S3 write permissions could tamper with deployment artifacts, potentially injecting malicious code.

#### Potential Impact
Could allow injection of unauthorized changes into deployment packages, leading to deployment of compromised resources.

#### Remediation
Consider implementing S3 Object Lock in compliance mode to prevent modification of deployment artifacts once they've been uploaded and validated.
