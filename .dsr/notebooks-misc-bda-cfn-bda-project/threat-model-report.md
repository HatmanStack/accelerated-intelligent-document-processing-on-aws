**Template:** `threat-model.md`  
**Analysis Date:** 2025-08-19_17-07-13  
**Generated By:** CloudFormation Threat Modeling Tool  

## Executive Summary

This threat model analysis identified **6** security threats. The analysis reveals **0** critical, **2** high, **3** medium, and **1** low severity findings.

## Priority Actions

### 1. Implement server-side encryption for the Bedrock service using AWS KMS with a customer-managed key (CMK) and ensure appropriate key management policies are in place.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** BEDROCK-DATA-AUTOMATION-THREAT-002  
**Business Impact:** Potential exposure of protected health information (PHI), resulting in compliance violations, regulatory fines, and loss of patient trust.

### 1. Define specific IAM roles with least privilege permissions for accessing and managing the Bedrock resources. Implement resource-based policies and consider using AWS Organizations SCPs to further restrict access.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** BEDROCK-DATA-AUTOMATION-THREAT-003  
**Business Impact:** Unauthorized access to PHI could lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and potential misuse of sensitive patient information.

### 2. Add CloudTrail configuration to the template to ensure comprehensive logging of all API calls to Bedrock services, and consider sending logs to a protected, dedicated S3 bucket with appropriate retention policies.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** BEDROCK-DATA-AUTOMATION-THREAT-001  
**Business Impact:** Inability to trace user actions, detect unauthorized access, or conduct forensic analysis after a security incident involving medical data.

### 2. Implement resource protection using AWS CloudFormation stack policies or AWS Organizations service control policies. Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline with proper approval gates for changes to the blueprint schema.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** BEDROCK-DATA-AUTOMATION-THREAT-004  
**Business Impact:** Unauthorized changes to data extraction logic could lead to data corruption, loss of integrity, or extraction of sensitive information in unexpected ways.

### 2. Implement CloudWatch alarms and metrics for the Bedrock services. Configure GuardDuty for threat detection and Security Hub for compliance monitoring. Set up automated notification systems for suspicious activities.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** BEDROCK-DATA-AUTOMATION-THREAT-006  
**Business Impact:** Delayed detection of security incidents or compliance violations involving PHI, potentially increasing the scope and impact of breaches.

### 3. Implement appropriate service quotas and request throttling for the Bedrock services. Configure CloudWatch alarms to detect abnormal usage patterns and automate responses.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** BEDROCK-DATA-AUTOMATION-THREAT-005  
**Business Impact:** Potential service unavailability for legitimate users and increased costs due to excessive resource consumption.



## Detailed Threat Analysis

## High Severity Threats

### BEDROCK-DATA-AUTOMATION-THREAT-002: No Encryption Configuration for Sensitive Medical Data

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `BedrockBlueprint` (AWS::Bedrock::Blueprint)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-311

#### Issue
The template does not specify encryption configurations for the Bedrock Blueprint that will process sensitive medical discharge information including patient names, IDs, and medical history.

#### Attack Vector
If data is not properly encrypted, unauthorized users with access to the AWS account could potentially view sensitive patient data in violation of healthcare privacy regulations.

#### Potential Impact
Potential exposure of protected health information (PHI), resulting in compliance violations, regulatory fines, and loss of patient trust.

#### Remediation
Implement server-side encryption for the Bedrock service using AWS KMS with a customer-managed key (CMK) and ensure appropriate key management policies are in place.

### BEDROCK-DATA-AUTOMATION-THREAT-003: Missing IAM Access Controls for Bedrock Resources

**STRIDE Category:** Authorization  
**Affected Resource:** `BedRockDataAutomationProject` (AWS::Bedrock::DataAutomationProject)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-284

#### Issue
The template does not define IAM roles or policies to restrict access to the Bedrock Data Automation Project and Blueprint containing sensitive medical information.

#### Attack Vector
Without proper IAM controls, any user with access to the AWS account could potentially access, modify, or delete the medical data processing resources.

#### Potential Impact
Unauthorized access to PHI could lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and potential misuse of sensitive patient information.

#### Remediation
Define specific IAM roles with least privilege permissions for accessing and managing the Bedrock resources. Implement resource-based policies and consider using AWS Organizations SCPs to further restrict access.

## Medium Severity Threats

### BEDROCK-DATA-AUTOMATION-THREAT-001: Missing CloudTrail Logging for Bedrock Operations

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `BedRockDataAutomationProject` (AWS::Bedrock::DataAutomationProject)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
The template does not configure CloudTrail logging for Bedrock operations, which could result in a lack of audit trail for actions performed on sensitive medical data.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker with access to the environment could perform unauthorized actions on the medical data processing pipeline without leaving traceable evidence.

#### Potential Impact
Inability to trace user actions, detect unauthorized access, or conduct forensic analysis after a security incident involving medical data.

#### Remediation
Add CloudTrail configuration to the template to ensure comprehensive logging of all API calls to Bedrock services, and consider sending logs to a protected, dedicated S3 bucket with appropriate retention policies.

### BEDROCK-DATA-AUTOMATION-THREAT-004: No Version Control or Change Protection for Blueprint Schema

**STRIDE Category:** Tampering  
**Affected Resource:** `BedrockBlueprint` (AWS::Bedrock::Blueprint)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-642

#### Issue
The template does not implement versioning or change protection mechanisms for the Bedrock Blueprint that defines the medical discharge data schema.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker with appropriate permissions could modify the blueprint schema to extract additional unauthorized data or change data extraction logic without detection.

#### Potential Impact
Unauthorized changes to data extraction logic could lead to data corruption, loss of integrity, or extraction of sensitive information in unexpected ways.

#### Remediation
Implement resource protection using AWS CloudFormation stack policies or AWS Organizations service control policies. Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline with proper approval gates for changes to the blueprint schema.

### BEDROCK-DATA-AUTOMATION-THREAT-006: Insufficient Monitoring and Alerting for Data Processing Activities

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `BedRockDataAutomationProject` (AWS::Bedrock::DataAutomationProject)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
The template lacks monitoring and alerting configurations for the Bedrock Data Automation Project handling sensitive medical information.

#### Attack Vector
Suspicious or unauthorized activities involving sensitive medical data could occur without timely detection or alerting.

#### Potential Impact
Delayed detection of security incidents or compliance violations involving PHI, potentially increasing the scope and impact of breaches.

#### Remediation
Implement CloudWatch alarms and metrics for the Bedrock services. Configure GuardDuty for threat detection and Security Hub for compliance monitoring. Set up automated notification systems for suspicious activities.

## Low Severity Threats

### BEDROCK-DATA-AUTOMATION-THREAT-005: No Resource Quotas or Throttling Controls

**STRIDE Category:** Denial of Service  
**Affected Resource:** `BedRockDataAutomationProject` (AWS::Bedrock::DataAutomationProject)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-770

#### Issue
The template does not define resource limits or throttling controls for the Bedrock Data Automation Project, potentially allowing resource exhaustion.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker or misconfigured application could submit an excessive number of processing requests, consuming all available resources and potentially causing service disruption.

#### Potential Impact
Potential service unavailability for legitimate users and increased costs due to excessive resource consumption.

#### Remediation
Implement appropriate service quotas and request throttling for the Bedrock services. Configure CloudWatch alarms to detect abnormal usage patterns and automate responses.
