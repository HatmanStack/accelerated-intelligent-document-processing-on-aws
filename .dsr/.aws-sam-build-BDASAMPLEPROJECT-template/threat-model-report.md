**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-001  
**Business Impact:** Potential unauthorized access to all Bedrock resources in the account, possible data exfiltration, and violation of least privilege security principle.

### 2. Implement code signing for Lambda functions using AWS Signer and validate the code signatures during deployment. Additionally, consider using versioned S3 objects with object lock to prevent tampering with the Lambda package.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-002  
**Business Impact:** Execution of unauthorized code that could manipulate Bedrock Data Automation projects and potentially access sensitive financial documents being processed.

### 2. Enable AWS CloudTrail data events for Bedrock API calls. Implement additional application-level logging within the Lambda function that captures detailed information about all Bedrock operations and their outcomes.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-003  
**Business Impact:** Difficulty in detecting malicious activities, investigating security incidents, and maintaining compliance with financial regulations for document processing systems.

### 2. Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit for all Bedrock resources. Add resource policies to restrict access to processed documents. Implement data classification and access controls specific to document types being processed. Consider implementing DLP (Data Loss Prevention) mechanisms.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-005  
**Business Impact:** Potential exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data, violating privacy regulations and potentially causing financial harm to customers.

### 3. Implement reserved concurrency limits on the Lambda function to ensure it only uses a reasonable portion of the account's total concurrency. Monitor Lambda throttling metrics to detect abnormal invocation patterns.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-004  
**Business Impact:** Potential disruption to other Lambda functions in the account, affecting availability of related services.

### 3. Consider deploying the Lambda function within a VPC with appropriate security groups and NACLs to restrict outbound traffic to only what's necessary. Use VPC endpoints for AWS services the function needs to access.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-006  
**Business Impact:** Increased attack surface and potential for data exfiltration if the function is compromised.



## Detailed Threat Analysis

## High Severity Threats

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-001: Overly Permissive IAM Role Policy

**STRIDE Category:** Elevation of Privilege  
**Affected Resource:** `LambdaExecutionRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-272

#### Issue
The LambdaExecutionRole policy grants wildcard (*) resource access to multiple Bedrock actions, violating the principle of least privilege. This allows the Lambda function to access any Bedrock project or blueprint in the account, not just those it needs.

#### Attack Vector
If the Lambda function is compromised, an attacker could leverage these broad permissions to access, modify, or delete any Bedrock Data Automation project or blueprint in the account.

#### Potential Impact
Potential unauthorized access to all Bedrock resources in the account, possible data exfiltration, and violation of least privilege security principle.

#### Remediation
Scope down the IAM policy to specific resources by replacing the wildcard (*) with specific ARNs for the resources the Lambda needs to access. For example, use project-specific ARNs for the Bedrock resources.

## Medium Severity Threats

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-002: Lambda Function Using Pre-Built Package Without Integrity Verification

**STRIDE Category:** Tampering  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProjectLambda` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-345

#### Issue
The Lambda function uses a pre-built package from an S3 bucket without any apparent integrity verification mechanism. The package could potentially be tampered with if the S3 bucket is compromised.

#### Attack Vector
If an attacker gains access to the S3 bucket containing the Lambda code package, they could modify it to include malicious code that would execute with the permissions of the Lambda role.

#### Potential Impact
Execution of unauthorized code that could manipulate Bedrock Data Automation projects and potentially access sensitive financial documents being processed.

#### Remediation
Implement code signing for Lambda functions using AWS Signer and validate the code signatures during deployment. Additionally, consider using versioned S3 objects with object lock to prevent tampering with the Lambda package.

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-003: Insufficient Audit Trail for Bedrock Operations

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProjectLambda` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
While the Lambda has basic execution role logging, there's no explicit configuration for detailed auditing of Bedrock Data Automation operations performed by the custom resource.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker who compromises the Lambda function could perform unauthorized actions on Bedrock resources without leaving sufficient audit trails to trace their activities.

#### Potential Impact
Difficulty in detecting malicious activities, investigating security incidents, and maintaining compliance with financial regulations for document processing systems.

#### Remediation
Enable AWS CloudTrail data events for Bedrock API calls. Implement additional application-level logging within the Lambda function that captures detailed information about all Bedrock operations and their outcomes.

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-005: Sensitive Document Processing Without Explicit Security Controls

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProject` (Custom::BDAProject)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-312

#### Issue
The template creates a Bedrock Data Automation project that processes sensitive financial documents (Bank Statements, Payslips, Driver Licenses, etc.) but doesn't explicitly define security controls for data protection during processing.

#### Attack Vector
If the Bedrock Data Automation infrastructure is misconfigured or compromised, sensitive personal and financial information from processed documents could be exposed.

#### Potential Impact
Potential exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data, violating privacy regulations and potentially causing financial harm to customers.

#### Remediation
Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit for all Bedrock resources. Add resource policies to restrict access to processed documents. Implement data classification and access controls specific to document types being processed. Consider implementing DLP (Data Loss Prevention) mechanisms.

## Low Severity Threats

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-004: Missing Concurrency Limits on Lambda Function

**STRIDE Category:** Denial of Service  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProjectLambda` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-400

#### Issue
The BDAProjectLambda function explicitly suppresses the W92 warning about missing concurrency limits. Without these limits, the function could potentially consume all available Lambda concurrency in the account during a deployment spike or if triggered repeatedly.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker could repeatedly invoke the function (if they gain access to trigger it) to deplete account Lambda concurrency limits, affecting other services in the account.

#### Potential Impact
Potential disruption to other Lambda functions in the account, affecting availability of related services.

#### Remediation
Implement reserved concurrency limits on the Lambda function to ensure it only uses a reasonable portion of the account's total concurrency. Monitor Lambda throttling metrics to detect abnormal invocation patterns.

**References:**
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-006: Lambda Function Without VPC Isolation

**STRIDE Category:** Spoofing  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProjectLambda` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-284

#### Issue
The BDAProjectLambda function explicitly suppresses the W89 warning about not requiring VPC access. This means the function runs outside a VPC, potentially increasing its attack surface and accessibility.

#### Attack Vector
While the function only interacts with AWS APIs, running outside a VPC means that if the function were compromised, an attacker would have direct internet access from the function execution environment.

#### Potential Impact
Increased attack surface and potential for data exfiltration if the function is compromised.

#### Remediation
Consider deploying the Lambda function within a VPC with appropriate security groups and NACLs to restrict outbound traffic to only what's necessary. Use VPC endpoints for AWS services the function needs to access.
