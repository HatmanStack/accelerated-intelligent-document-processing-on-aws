### GENAI-IDP-THREAT-011: Inconsistent Lambda Function Log Retention Periods

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `Multiple Lambda Functions` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
Some Lambda functions have explicitly configured log retention periods, while others rely on default settings. This inconsistency could lead to premature deletion of important log data or unnecessary storage costs.

#### Attack Vector
A malicious actor's activities might not be traceable if logs are deleted before security investigations can take place due to short retention periods.

#### Potential Impact
Potential loss of important audit trail information, making security investigations and compliance verification more difficult.

#### Remediation
Ensure all Lambda function log groups have consistent retention periods based on organizational security and compliance requirements by explicitly setting RetentionInDays for every LogGroup resource.

**References:**
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Working-with-log-groups-and-streams.html

### GENAI-IDP-THREAT-012: Lambda Functions Without Reserved Concurrency

**STRIDE Category:** Denial of Service  
**Affected Resource:** `Multiple Lambda Functions` (AWS::Lambda::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-400

#### Issue
Most Lambda functions in the template do not have reserved concurrency configured, which could lead to resource exhaustion if one function consumes all available Lambda concurrency in the AWS account.

#### Attack Vector
A sudden spike in requests to one function could consume all available concurrency, preventing other Lambda functions from executing and causing a denial of service for other parts of the application.

#### Potential Impact
Potential service disruption if a high-volume Lambda function consumes all available concurrency, affecting the availability of other functions in the account.

#### Remediation
Configure reserved concurrency for critical Lambda functions to ensure they always have capacity to run, and consider adding provisioned concurrency for functions with predictable traffic patterns.

### GENAI-IDP-THREAT-008: Short Token Validity Period for Cognito User Pool

**STRIDE Category:** Spoofing  
**Affected Resource:** `UserPoolClient` (AWS::Cognito::UserPoolClient)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-613

#### Issue
The UserPoolClient has a very short token validity period (IdTokenValidity and AccessTokenValidity set to 1), which could lead to frequent re-authentication and potentially encourage insecure practices like token caching.

#### Attack Vector
Frequent token expiration might lead developers to implement insecure token handling practices, such as client-side caching of credentials, making the application more susceptible to session hijacking.

#### Potential Impact
Potential for reduced security if developers implement workarounds for the frequent token expiration, or poor user experience due to frequent re-authentication requirements.

#### Remediation
Consider increasing the token validity period to a more reasonable value (e.g., 60 minutes for access tokens) while implementing proper token refresh mechanisms and secure token storage practices.
