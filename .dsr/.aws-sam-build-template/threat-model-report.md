### GENAI-IDP-THREAT-006: GraphQL API Field-Level Logging Not Always Set to ALL

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `GraphQLApi` (AWS::AppSync::GraphQLApi)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
The GraphQL API field-level logging is conditionally set based on the LogLevel parameter. When set to WARN, ERROR, or CRITICAL, the field-level logging is set to ERROR only, which means some operations may not be fully logged.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker performing reconnaissance or initial probing might not generate ERROR-level logs, making their activities harder to detect when the system is configured with WARN or higher log levels.

#### Potential Impact
Reduced ability to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents, potentially allowing malicious activities to go unnoticed.

#### Remediation
Consider always setting field-level logging to ALL regardless of the general logging level to ensure comprehensive audit trails for security monitoring. Create separate log filters for operational purposes if log volume is a concern.

### GENAI-IDP-THREAT-007: SQS Queue Could Be More Restrictive

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `DocumentQueue` (AWS::SQS::Queue)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-732

#### Issue
The DocumentQueue and other SQS queues have policies that only enforce SSL/TLS connections but do not implement strict resource-based policies to limit which principals can interact with the queues.

#### Attack Vector
If an IAM role or user has overly permissive SQS permissions, they could potentially read messages from or send messages to these queues, even if that wasn't intended.

#### Potential Impact
Potential unauthorized access to document processing pipeline, which could lead to information disclosure or pipeline manipulation.

#### Remediation
Enhance SQS queue policies to explicitly limit access to only the specific IAM roles and services that require it. Add explicit Deny statements for principals not in the allowed list.

**References:**
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-security-best-practices.html

---

### GENAI-IDP-THREAT-009: Short-lived Cognito Token Refresh Window

**STRIDE Category:** Spoofing  
**Affected Resource:** `UserPoolClient` (AWS::Cognito::UserPoolClient)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-613

#### Issue
The Cognito UserPoolClient has RefreshTokenValidity set to 30 days, but AccessTokenValidity and IdTokenValidity are both set to only 1 hour. This short validity window could lead to frequent re-authentication needs and potential session handling issues.

#### Attack Vector
If the application doesn't properly handle token refresh, users might be prompted to re-authenticate frequently, potentially leading to authentication fatigue where users choose weaker passwords or become more susceptible to phishing.

#### Potential Impact
Increased user frustration and potential for phishing attacks targeting users who are frequently asked to re-authenticate.

#### Remediation
Consider increasing the AccessTokenValidity and IdTokenValidity to a more reasonable duration (e.g., 1 day) while ensuring the application properly handles token refresh before expiration.

**References:**
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-with-identity-providers.html

---

### GENAI-IDP-THREAT-010: Lambda Role with Permissions to Modify Event Rules and Lambda Permissions

**STRIDE Category:** Elevation of Privilege  
**Affected Resource:** `StartUICodeBuildExecutionRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-269

#### Issue
The StartUICodeBuildExecutionRole has permissions to create and delete EventBridge rules and add/remove Lambda permissions for any Lambda function. These powerful permissions could be abused for privilege escalation.

#### Attack Vector
If this Lambda function is compromised, an attacker could create event rules that trigger other functions or add permissions allowing external services to invoke Lambda functions.

#### Potential Impact
Potential for privilege escalation and unauthorized configuration changes that could lead to persistent access or service disruption.

#### Remediation
Scope down the permissions to specific resource ARNs rather than using wildcards. Limit the lambda:AddPermission and lambda:RemovePermission actions to only the specific Lambda functions that need these permissions modified.

**References:**
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege

---

### GENAI-IDP-THREAT-011: CORs Configuration Allows localhost Development Access

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `InputBucket, OutputBucket, ConfigurationBucket` (AWS::S3::Bucket)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-346

#### Issue
The CORS configuration for several S3 buckets includes 'http://localhost:3000' as an allowed origin. While useful for development, this should not be present in production deployments as it may facilitate cross-origin attacks.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker who can trick a user into accessing a malicious site on their localhost could potentially access resources from these buckets through the browser, bypassing same-origin policies.

#### Potential Impact
Potential for cross-origin attacks that could expose sensitive data from S3 buckets when users have local applications running.

#### Remediation
Remove 'http://localhost:3000' from the AllowedOrigins list in production deployments. Consider using a parameter to conditionally include this only in development environments.

**References:**
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html

---

### GENAI-IDP-THREAT-012: Log Retention Period May Be Too Short for Compliance

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `Multiple LogGroups` (AWS::Logs::LogGroup)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
The LogRetentionDays parameter allows setting log retention as low as 1 day, which may be insufficient for security investigation and compliance requirements. Many regulatory frameworks require logs to be kept for much longer periods.

#### Attack Vector
Attackers who compromise the system could evade detection if logs are rotated quickly, as evidence of their activities would be deleted.

#### Potential Impact
Reduced ability to investigate security incidents after they occur and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements for log retention.

#### Remediation
Set a higher minimum value for the LogRetentionDays parameter (e.g., at least 90 days) to ensure sufficient time for security investigations. Consider archiving logs to more cost-effective storage for longer retention.

### GENAI-IDP-THREAT-013: SQS Queue Vulnerable to Message Flooding

**STRIDE Category:** Denial of Service  
**Affected Resource:** `DocumentQueue` (AWS::SQS::Queue)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-400

#### Issue
The DocumentQueue has no specific protection against message flooding. While SQS has built-in throttling, additional safeguards like queue quotas or throttling at the application level are not implemented.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker with permissions to send messages to SQS could flood the queue with messages, potentially causing processing delays, increased costs, or resource exhaustion.

#### Potential Impact
Potential degradation of document processing service, delayed processing, and increased AWS costs.

#### Remediation
Implement a throttling mechanism before messages are sent to SQS, such as a Lambda concurrency limit or API Gateway throttling. Consider adding CloudWatch alarms for queue metrics to detect unusual patterns.

**References:**
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html

---

### GENAI-IDP-THREAT-015: GraphQL Schema Introspection Enabled

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `GraphQLSchema` (AWS::AppSync::GraphQLSchema)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-306

#### Issue
While IntrospectionConfig is set to DISABLED, which is good, the template references an external schema file that may not have proper field-level authorization controls. Without examining the actual schema, there's a risk that certain fields might be accessible without proper authorization.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker with limited permissions could potentially query fields or mutations they shouldn't have access to if the schema doesn't implement proper authorization directives.

#### Potential Impact
Potential exposure of sensitive data or operations to users who shouldn't have access to them.

#### Remediation
Review the GraphQL schema to ensure all sensitive fields and operations have proper @auth directives or resolver-level authorization checks. Consider implementing a security review process for schema changes.

**References:**
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security.html

### GENAI-IDP-THREAT-019: Extensive Permissions for Code Interpreter

**STRIDE Category:** Elevation of Privilege  
**Affected Resource:** `AnalyticsProcessorFunction` (AWS::Lambda::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-94

#### Issue
The AnalyticsProcessorFunction is granted extensive permissions to start and use Bedrock's code interpreter functionality with minimal restrictions. This could be abused if the function's input is compromised.

#### Attack Vector
If an attacker can control the input to the analytics processor function, they might be able to execute arbitrary code through the code interpreter, potentially accessing or modifying resources beyond intended boundaries.

#### Potential Impact
Potential for code execution that could lead to data access, policy manipulation, or other unauthorized actions within the boundaries of the function's IAM permissions.

#### Remediation
Implement strict input validation for all user-provided content that might influence code interpreter execution. Consider implementing additional sandboxing or approval workflows for code interpreter operations.

**References:**
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters.html

---

### GENAI-IDP-THREAT-020: Unprotected Settings Storage in SSM Parameter Store

**STRIDE Category:** Tampering  
**Affected Resource:** `UpdateSettingsValues` (AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-732

#### Issue
The template stores application settings in an SSM Parameter Store parameter that is readable by the CognitoAuthorizedRole. This means any authenticated user could potentially read these settings, which might contain sensitive configuration values.

#### Attack Vector
Any authenticated user with the CognitoAuthorizedRole could read the SSM parameter and potentially discover sensitive configuration details that might aid in further attacks.

#### Potential Impact
Exposure of internal configuration details that could assist attackers in understanding the system architecture and identifying additional attack vectors.

#### Remediation
Store sensitive configuration in SecureString parameters and restrict access to only the services that require them. Consider separating configuration values based on sensitivity and implementing different access controls for each category.

**References:**
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-securing-parameters.html
