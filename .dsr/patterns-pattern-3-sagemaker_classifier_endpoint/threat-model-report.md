## Detailed Threat Analysis

## High Severity Threats

### SAGEMAKER-INFERENCE-ENDPOINT-THREAT-003: Overly Permissive IAM Role

**STRIDE Category:** Elevation of Privilege  
**Affected Resource:** `UDOPExecutionRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-272

#### Issue
The UDOPExecutionRole has the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess managed policy attached, which grants excessive permissions beyond what is required for model inference.

#### Attack Vector
If the execution role credentials are compromised or if there's a vulnerability in the application, an attacker could leverage these excessive permissions to access other SageMaker resources or perform unauthorized actions.

#### Potential Impact
Potential unauthorized access to other SageMaker resources, violation of least privilege principle, and increased blast radius in case of compromise.

#### Remediation
Replace the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess managed policy with a custom IAM policy that includes only the specific permissions needed for model inference. Specifically, restrict permissions to the minimum required for the model endpoint to function.

## Medium Severity Threats

### SAGEMAKER-INFERENCE-ENDPOINT-THREAT-001: Missing KMS Encryption for SageMaker Endpoint

**STRIDE Category:** Tampering  
**Affected Resource:** `UDOPEndpointConfig` (AWS::SageMaker::EndpointConfig)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-311

#### Issue
The SageMaker EndpointConfig is deployed without KMS encryption, as indicated by the suppression of the W1200 rule. This could leave data processed by the endpoint vulnerable to unauthorized access if the underlying storage is compromised.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker with access to the underlying storage could potentially access unencrypted data processed by the SageMaker endpoint.

#### Potential Impact
Potential exposure of sensitive data processed by the model, which could include proprietary or regulated information.

#### Remediation
Enable KMS encryption for the SageMaker EndpointConfig by adding the KmsKeyId property with the CustomerManagedEncryptionKeyArn parameter. If NVMe instance storage is required, evaluate the use of instance types that support KMS encryption.

### SAGEMAKER-INFERENCE-ENDPOINT-THREAT-002: Container Network Access Not Restricted

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `UDOPModel` (AWS::SageMaker::Model)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-668

#### Issue
The SageMaker model container has network access to S3 (as indicated by the commented checkov skip), but no explicit network isolation configuration is specified. This could allow the container to make unintended outbound connections.

#### Attack Vector
If the model or container is compromised, an attacker could exfiltrate data via outbound network connections to destinations other than required AWS services.

#### Potential Impact
Potential data exfiltration or unauthorized communication from the inference container.

#### Remediation
Enable NetworkIsolation property on the SageMaker Model resource. If external network access is required, use VpcConfig to restrict network traffic through a controlled VPC environment with appropriate security groups.

### SAGEMAKER-INFERENCE-ENDPOINT-THREAT-004: Missing Monitoring and Logging Configuration

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `UDOPEndpoint` (AWS::SageMaker::Endpoint)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
The template does not define any CloudWatch logging configuration for the SageMaker endpoint, which limits audit capability and visibility into model inference activities.

#### Attack Vector
Without proper logging, unauthorized access or misuse of the endpoint might go undetected, and there would be limited forensic evidence in case of a security incident.

#### Potential Impact
Reduced ability to detect and investigate potential security incidents, compliance issues due to lack of audit trails.

#### Remediation
Enable CloudWatch logging for the SageMaker endpoint by configuring the EndpointConfig with appropriate logging levels. Consider implementing CloudTrail for API call logging and setting up CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activities.

### SAGEMAKER-INFERENCE-ENDPOINT-THREAT-006: No Integrity Verification for Model Artifacts

**STRIDE Category:** Tampering  
**Affected Resource:** `UDOPModel` (AWS::SageMaker::Model)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-354

#### Issue
There is no mechanism to verify the integrity of the model artifacts loaded from S3. Without integrity checks, there's a risk that the model artifacts could be tampered with between upload and deployment.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker with write access to the S3 bucket could potentially modify the model artifacts, resulting in a compromised model being deployed.

#### Potential Impact
Deployment of modified or malicious model code, potentially leading to incorrect predictions, data leakage, or other malicious behavior.

#### Remediation
Implement model artifact integrity verification by using S3 Object Lock with legal hold or retention periods, versioning, and consider implementing checksums or digital signatures for the model artifacts. Verify these signatures during the deployment process.

### SAGEMAKER-INFERENCE-ENDPOINT-THREAT-007: Environment Variables Containing Sensitive Information

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `UDOPModel` (AWS::SageMaker::Model)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-214

#### Issue
The model container environment variables are defined in the template and might be exposed via various SageMaker APIs or logs. Some of these could potentially contain sensitive information.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker with read access to the SageMaker environment could potentially view these environment variables through describe APIs or logs.

#### Potential Impact
Potential exposure of configuration details that could aid in further attacks or reveal sensitive operational information.

#### Remediation
Review environment variables for sensitive information. Consider using AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store with KMS encryption for sensitive configuration values and accessing them securely from within the container. Ensure proper IAM restrictions on who can describe SageMaker resources.
