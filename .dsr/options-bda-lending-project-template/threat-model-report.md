# CloudFormation Threat Model Report

**Template:** `threat-model.md`  
**Analysis Date:** 2025-08-19_17-07-17  
**Generated By:** CloudFormation Threat Modeling Tool  

## Executive Summary

This threat model analysis identified **5** security threats. The analysis reveals **0** critical, **1** high, **3** medium, and **1** low severity findings.

## Priority Actions

### 1. Scope down the IAM policy to specific resources where possible. Replace the wildcard resource with specific ARNs of the Bedrock resources this Lambda function needs to access. If resource-level permissions are not supported for specific actions, implement additional guardrails such as tagging strategies or conditions in the policy.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-001  
**Business Impact:** Unauthorized access to Bedrock resources could lead to data exfiltration, resource manipulation, or disruption of other services using Bedrock in the organization.

### 2. Enhance the Lambda function code to implement detailed audit logging that captures all significant administrative actions, including who performed them, when, and what was changed. Consider implementing a dedicated audit trail storage mechanism separate from operational logs. Enable AWS CloudTrail data events for relevant Bedrock API calls.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-002  
**Business Impact:** Reduced ability to detect unauthorized activities, troubleshoot issues, or meet compliance requirements that mandate comprehensive audit trails for administrative actions.

### 2. Implement explicit security controls for data processing: 1) Ensure encryption in transit and at rest for all document data, 2) Define clear access boundaries and permissions for processed documents, 3) Implement data lifecycle policies to ensure data is retained only as long as necessary, 4) Consider adding resource policies that restrict which principals can access the processed data.

**Effort:** High  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-003  
**Business Impact:** Potential exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data could lead to regulatory violations, privacy breaches, and damage to customer trust.

### 2. Implement integrity verification mechanisms: 1) Use checksums or digital signatures to validate blueprint integrity, 2) Implement a formal change management process for blueprints, 3) Consider using AWS CodePipeline with approval gates for blueprint deployment, 4) Add regular automated scanning of blueprints for malicious patterns.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-005  
**Business Impact:** Data processing logic could be compromised, potentially leading to data leakage, incorrect document classification, or insertion of malicious logic into the document processing workflow.

### 3. Consider implementing appropriate concurrency controls: 1) Set reserved concurrency to guarantee execution capacity for this function, 2) Set maximum concurrency limits to prevent resource exhaustion, 3) Implement throttling or queuing mechanisms for high-volume scenarios.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-004  
**Business Impact:** Potential service degradation or unavailability of other Lambda functions in the same AWS account, leading to broader application disruption.



## Detailed Threat Analysis

## High Severity Threats

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-001: Overly Permissive IAM Policy

**STRIDE Category:** Elevation of Privilege  
**Affected Resource:** `LambdaExecutionRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-272

#### Issue
The LambdaExecutionRole contains a policy with wildcard (*) resources for Bedrock actions, violating the principle of least privilege. This allows the Lambda function to access potentially all Bedrock resources in the account.

#### Attack Vector
If the Lambda function is compromised, an attacker could leverage these excessive permissions to access, modify, or delete any Bedrock data automation project or blueprint in the account, including those unrelated to this specific application.

#### Potential Impact
Unauthorized access to Bedrock resources could lead to data exfiltration, resource manipulation, or disruption of other services using Bedrock in the organization.

#### Remediation
Scope down the IAM policy to specific resources where possible. Replace the wildcard resource with specific ARNs of the Bedrock resources this Lambda function needs to access. If resource-level permissions are not supported for specific actions, implement additional guardrails such as tagging strategies or conditions in the policy.

## Medium Severity Threats

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-002: Insufficient Logging for Administrative Actions

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProjectLambda` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
The Lambda function responsible for creating and managing Bedrock Data Automation resources has basic CloudWatch logging but lacks comprehensive audit logging for sensitive administrative actions. While LOG_LEVEL is configurable, there's no explicit configuration for capturing detailed audit trails of resource creation, modification, or deletion events.

#### Attack Vector
Without proper audit logs, unauthorized changes to Bedrock resources could be made without adequate traceability, making it difficult to investigate security incidents or prove compliance.

#### Potential Impact
Reduced ability to detect unauthorized activities, troubleshoot issues, or meet compliance requirements that mandate comprehensive audit trails for administrative actions.

#### Remediation
Enhance the Lambda function code to implement detailed audit logging that captures all significant administrative actions, including who performed them, when, and what was changed. Consider implementing a dedicated audit trail storage mechanism separate from operational logs. Enable AWS CloudTrail data events for relevant Bedrock API calls.

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-003: Sensitive Data Processing Without Explicit Security Controls

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProject` (Custom::BDAProject)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-311

#### Issue
The template processes potentially sensitive lending documents (bank statements, payslips, driver's licenses, etc.) using Bedrock Data Automation, but does not explicitly define security controls for data protection such as encryption requirements, access restrictions, or data handling policies.

#### Attack Vector
Without proper security controls, sensitive personal and financial information contained in these documents could be exposed during processing, storage, or transmission within the Bedrock service.

#### Potential Impact
Potential exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data could lead to regulatory violations, privacy breaches, and damage to customer trust.

#### Remediation
Implement explicit security controls for data processing: 1) Ensure encryption in transit and at rest for all document data, 2) Define clear access boundaries and permissions for processed documents, 3) Implement data lifecycle policies to ensure data is retained only as long as necessary, 4) Consider adding resource policies that restrict which principals can access the processed data.

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-005: Missing Version Control and Integrity Verification

**STRIDE Category:** Tampering  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProject` (Custom::BDAProject)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-345

#### Issue
While the template specifies a 'Version' property for the BDA project, there's no mechanism to validate the integrity of blueprints or ensure they haven't been tampered with. The deployment process doesn't include checksum verification or source control integration for the blueprints being used.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker with sufficient access could potentially modify blueprint definitions or swap them with malicious versions that could extract or manipulate sensitive data being processed.

#### Potential Impact
Data processing logic could be compromised, potentially leading to data leakage, incorrect document classification, or insertion of malicious logic into the document processing workflow.

#### Remediation
Implement integrity verification mechanisms: 1) Use checksums or digital signatures to validate blueprint integrity, 2) Implement a formal change management process for blueprints, 3) Consider using AWS CodePipeline with approval gates for blueprint deployment, 4) Add regular automated scanning of blueprints for malicious patterns.

## Low Severity Threats

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-004: Missing Concurrency Controls

**STRIDE Category:** Denial of Service  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProjectLambda` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-400

#### Issue
The BDAProjectLambda function does not have reserved concurrency or concurrency limits defined. The template explicitly skips this control (CKV_AWS_115). While this may be an intentional design choice, it leaves the function vulnerable to potential resource exhaustion.

#### Attack Vector
In a high-traffic environment or during a spike in requests, the Lambda function could consume all available execution capacity in the AWS account, potentially affecting other functions and services.

#### Potential Impact
Potential service degradation or unavailability of other Lambda functions in the same AWS account, leading to broader application disruption.

#### Remediation
Consider implementing appropriate concurrency controls: 1) Set reserved concurrency to guarantee execution capacity for this function, 2) Set maximum concurrency limits to prevent resource exhaustion, 3) Implement throttling or queuing mechanisms for high-volume scenarios.
