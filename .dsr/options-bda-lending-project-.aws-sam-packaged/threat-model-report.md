**Template:** `threat-model.md`  
**Analysis Date:** 2025-08-19_17-07-29  
**Generated By:** CloudFormation Threat Modeling Tool  

## Executive Summary

This threat model analysis identified **7** security threats. The analysis reveals **0** critical, **2** high, **4** medium, and **1** low severity findings.

## Priority Actions

### 1. Scope down the IAM policy to specific resources where possible. Replace the wildcard '*' with specific ARNs for the projects and blueprints this function needs to manage. If wildcard is absolutely necessary for some operations, consider using condition keys to limit the scope (e.g., by project name or tag).

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-001  
**Business Impact:** Unauthorized access to Bedrock resources could lead to data leakage, resource manipulation, or creation of unauthorized resources resulting in security breaches or unexpected costs.

### 1. Ensure the S3 bucket has appropriate access controls with bucket policies that restrict access. Implement server-side encryption for the S3 bucket. Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for any sensitive values instead of embedding them in code. Implement automated code scanning to detect and prevent secrets from being committed.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-006  
**Business Impact:** Exposure of proprietary code, potential disclosure of embedded secrets or configuration, and increased risk of targeted attacks based on knowledge of internal systems.

### 2. Enhance the logging configuration by implementing comprehensive CloudTrail logging for all Bedrock API calls. Consider implementing custom application-level logging that captures detailed information about all administrative actions performed by the Lambda function, including who initiated them and what changes were made.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-002  
**Business Impact:** Reduced ability to detect unauthorized changes, troubleshoot issues, or perform forensic analysis after security incidents.

### 2. Implement appropriate concurrency limits on the Lambda function using the ReservedConcurrentExecutions property. Consider implementing appropriate throttling mechanisms and exponential backoff retry strategies in the function code.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-003  
**Business Impact:** Potential service disruption, increased costs, and degraded performance for other applications sharing the same account resources.

### 2. Deploy the Lambda function within a VPC with appropriate security groups and use VPC endpoints for AWS services to keep traffic private. If internet access is required, implement a NAT Gateway with appropriate routing and security controls.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-004  
**Business Impact:** Increased risk of data exfiltration and potential for compromised functions to communicate with external malicious servers.

### 2. Implement additional detective controls such as AWS Config rules or CloudWatch Events to monitor and alert on unauthorized changes to the Bedrock Data Automation project. Consider implementing infrastructure as code deployment pipelines with appropriate approval processes for any changes.

**Effort:** Medium  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-005  
**Business Impact:** Potential for sensitive document data to be compromised or for the document processing workflow to be manipulated in ways that could lead to security breaches or incorrect processing results.

### 3. Implement standard semantic versioning practices (e.g., 1.0.0) rather than using dates as version identifiers, especially future dates. Consider using AWS resource tagging with standardized version tags to maintain version information.

**Effort:** Low  
**Related Threats:** GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-007  
**Business Impact:** Potential for confusion in resource management, difficulties in determining which version of resources are deployed, and possible operational errors.



## Detailed Threat Analysis

## High Severity Threats

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-001: Overly Permissive IAM Policy with Wildcard Resource

**STRIDE Category:** Elevation of Privilege  
**Affected Resource:** `LambdaExecutionRole` (AWS::IAM::Role)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-272

#### Issue
The LambdaExecutionRole contains a policy that grants access to Bedrock Data Automation services using wildcard ('*') resource specifier. This violates the principle of least privilege by potentially allowing access to all Bedrock resources rather than limiting to specific resources needed.

#### Attack Vector
If the Lambda function or its credentials are compromised, an attacker could use these permissions to access, modify, or delete any Bedrock Data Automation resources in the account, including those not related to this specific project.

#### Potential Impact
Unauthorized access to Bedrock resources could lead to data leakage, resource manipulation, or creation of unauthorized resources resulting in security breaches or unexpected costs.

#### Remediation
Scope down the IAM policy to specific resources where possible. Replace the wildcard '*' with specific ARNs for the projects and blueprints this function needs to manage. If wildcard is absolutely necessary for some operations, consider using condition keys to limit the scope (e.g., by project name or tag).

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-006: S3 CodeUri with Potential Data Exposure Risk

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProjectLambda` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-200

#### Issue
The Lambda function references code stored in an S3 bucket ('bobs-artifacts-us-west-2') with a specific path that might be accessible to unauthorized users if the bucket has improper access controls. This could expose proprietary code or potentially sensitive information embedded in the code.

#### Attack Vector
If the S3 bucket has misconfigured permissions or if an attacker gains access to the bucket, they could access the Lambda function code, potentially discovering hardcoded secrets, internal logic, or other sensitive information.

#### Potential Impact
Exposure of proprietary code, potential disclosure of embedded secrets or configuration, and increased risk of targeted attacks based on knowledge of internal systems.

#### Remediation
Ensure the S3 bucket has appropriate access controls with bucket policies that restrict access. Implement server-side encryption for the S3 bucket. Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for any sensitive values instead of embedding them in code. Implement automated code scanning to detect and prevent secrets from being committed.

## Medium Severity Threats

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-002: Insufficient Logging for Administrative Actions

**STRIDE Category:** Repudiation  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProjectLambda` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-778

#### Issue
While the Lambda function has basic logging enabled via AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole, there's no evidence of comprehensive logging for the administrative actions performed by the function on Bedrock Data Automation resources. This could lead to difficulty in tracing actions and changes.

#### Attack Vector
Without proper logging, malicious actions or mistakes made using the function's permissions may not be properly tracked, making forensic analysis difficult in case of a security incident.

#### Potential Impact
Reduced ability to detect unauthorized changes, troubleshoot issues, or perform forensic analysis after security incidents.

#### Remediation
Enhance the logging configuration by implementing comprehensive CloudTrail logging for all Bedrock API calls. Consider implementing custom application-level logging that captures detailed information about all administrative actions performed by the Lambda function, including who initiated them and what changes were made.

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-003: Missing Concurrency Limits and Rate Controls

**STRIDE Category:** Denial of Service  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProjectLambda` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-770

#### Issue
The Lambda function does not specify any concurrency limits or throttling controls, which could lead to resource exhaustion under high load or in case of a recursive invocation scenario. The cfn_nag suppression explicitly states that no concurrent execution limits are implemented.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker could potentially trigger numerous concurrent executions of the Lambda function, causing resource exhaustion or unexpected costs. This could also impact other services and applications that rely on the same resources.

#### Potential Impact
Potential service disruption, increased costs, and degraded performance for other applications sharing the same account resources.

#### Remediation
Implement appropriate concurrency limits on the Lambda function using the ReservedConcurrentExecutions property. Consider implementing appropriate throttling mechanisms and exponential backoff retry strategies in the function code.

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-004: Lambda Function Without VPC Configuration

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProjectLambda` (AWS::Serverless::Function)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-668

#### Issue
The Lambda function is deployed without a VPC configuration as indicated by the cfn_nag suppression comment. This means the function operates directly on the public AWS API endpoints rather than through private VPC endpoints, potentially increasing the attack surface.

#### Attack Vector
If the Lambda function is compromised, an attacker would have direct internet access from the function's execution environment, which could be used for data exfiltration or communication with malicious command and control servers.

#### Potential Impact
Increased risk of data exfiltration and potential for compromised functions to communicate with external malicious servers.

#### Remediation
Deploy the Lambda function within a VPC with appropriate security groups and use VPC endpoints for AWS services to keep traffic private. If internet access is required, implement a NAT Gateway with appropriate routing and security controls.

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-005: No Immutability Controls for Bedrock Data Automation Project

**STRIDE Category:** Tampering  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProject` (Custom::BDAProject)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-642

#### Issue
The template creates a Bedrock Data Automation project with blueprints for processing potentially sensitive documents (bank statements, payslips, driver's licenses) but lacks controls to prevent unauthorized modifications to the project configuration after deployment.

#### Attack Vector
An attacker with appropriate IAM permissions could modify the project configuration or blueprints to exfiltrate sensitive data processed by the system or introduce malicious behavior.

#### Potential Impact
Potential for sensitive document data to be compromised or for the document processing workflow to be manipulated in ways that could lead to security breaches or incorrect processing results.

#### Remediation
Implement additional detective controls such as AWS Config rules or CloudWatch Events to monitor and alert on unauthorized changes to the Bedrock Data Automation project. Consider implementing infrastructure as code deployment pipelines with appropriate approval processes for any changes.

## Low Severity Threats

### GENAIIDP-SAMPLE-LENDING-PROJECT-THREAT-007: Potential Version Control Issue in Custom Resource

**STRIDE Category:** Spoofing  
**Affected Resource:** `BDAProject` (Custom::BDAProject)  
**CWE ID:** CWE-1288

#### Issue
The BDAProject custom resource includes a 'Version' property with a future date value ('04-04-2025'), which could be a mistake or an attempt at version control. This unusual versioning approach could lead to confusion or errors in resource management.

#### Attack Vector
While not directly exploitable, this unusual versioning practice could create confusion that might be leveraged in social engineering attacks or lead to operational errors that create security vulnerabilities.

#### Potential Impact
Potential for confusion in resource management, difficulties in determining which version of resources are deployed, and possible operational errors.

#### Remediation
Implement standard semantic versioning practices (e.g., 1.0.0) rather than using dates as version identifiers, especially future dates. Consider using AWS resource tagging with standardized version tags to maintain version information.
