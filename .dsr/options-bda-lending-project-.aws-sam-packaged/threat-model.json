This violates the principle of least privilege by potentially allowing access to all Bedrock resources rather than limiting to specific resources needed.",

    "remediation": "Scope down the IAM policy to specific resources where possible. Replace the wildcard '*' with specific ARNs for the projects and blueprints this function needs to manage. If wildcard is absolutely necessary for some operations, consider using condition keys to limit the scope (e.g., by project name or tag).",
