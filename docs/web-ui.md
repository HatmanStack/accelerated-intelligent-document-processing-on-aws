# GenAIIDP Web User Interface

The solution includes a responsive web-based user interface built with React that provides comprehensive document management and monitoring capabilities.

## Features

- Document tracking and monitoring capabilities
- Real-time status updates of document processing
- Secure authentication using Amazon Cognito
- Searchable document history
- Detailed document processing metrics and status information
- Inspection of processing outputs for section classification and information extraction
- Accuracy evaluation reports when baseline data is provided
- View and edit pattern configuration, including document classes, prompt engineering, and model settings
- Document upload from local computer
- Knowledge base querying for document collections

## Authentication Features

The web UI uses Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication and authorization:

### User Management

- Admin users can be created during stack deployment
- Optional self-service sign-up with email domain restrictions
- Automatic email verification
- Password policies and account recovery

### Security Controls

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
- Temporary credentials and automatic token refresh
- Role-based access control using Cognito user groups
- Secure session management

## Deploying the Web UI

The web UI is automatically deployed as part of the CloudFormation stack. The deployment:

1. Creates required Cognito resources (User Pool, Identity Pool)
2. Builds and deploys the React application to S3
3. Sets up CloudFront distribution for content delivery
4. Configures necessary IAM roles and permissions

## Accessing the Web UI

Once the stack is deployed:

1. Navigate to the `ApplicationWebURL` provided in the stack outputs
2. For first-time access:
   - Use the admin email address specified during stack deployment
   - Check your email for temporary credentials
   - You will be prompted to change your password on first login

## Running the UI Locally

To run the web UI locally for development:

1. Navigate to the `/ui` directory
2. Create a `.env` file using the `WebUITestEnvFile` output from the CloudFormation stack:
```
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_ID=<value>
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=<value>
REACT_APP_IDENTITY_POOL_ID=<value>
REACT_APP_APPSYNC_GRAPHQL_URL=<value>
REACT_APP_AWS_REGION=<value>
REACT_APP_SETTINGS_PARAMETER=<value>
```
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run start`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Configuration Options

The following parameters are configured during stack deployment:

- `AdminEmail`: Email address for the admin user
- `AllowedSignUpEmailDomain`: Optional comma-separated list of allowed email domains for self-service signup

## Security Considerations

The web UI implementation includes several security features:

- All communication is encrypted using HTTPS
- Authentication tokens are automatically rotated
- Session timeouts are enforced
- CloudFront distribution uses secure configuration
- S3 buckets are configured with appropriate security policies
- API access is controlled through IAM and Cognito
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection for AppSync API

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)

The solution includes AWS WAF integration to protect your AppSync API:

- **IP-based access control**: Restrict API access to specific IP ranges
- **Default behavior**: By default (`0.0.0.0/0`), WAF is disabled and all IPs are allowed
- **Configuration**: Use the `WAFAllowedIPv4Ranges` parameter to specify allowed IP ranges
  - Example: `"192.168.1.0/24,10.0.0.0/16"` (comma-separated list of CIDR blocks)
- **Security benefit**: When properly configured, WAF blocks all traffic except from your trusted IP ranges and AWS Lambda service IP ranges
- **Lambda service access**: The solution automatically maintains a WAF IPSet with current AWS Lambda service IP ranges to ensure Lambda functions can always access the AppSync API even when IP restrictions are enabled

When configuring the WAF:
- IP ranges must be in valid CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)
- Multiple ranges should be comma-separated
- The WAF is only enabled when the parameter is set to something other than the default `0.0.0.0/0`
- Lambda functions within your account will automatically have access to the AppSync API regardless of IP restrictions

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

The web UI includes built-in monitoring:

- CloudWatch metrics for API and authentication activity
- Access logs in CloudWatch Logs
- CloudFront distribution logs
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance monitoring

To troubleshoot issues:

1. Check CloudWatch Logs for application errors
2. Verify Cognito user status in the AWS Console
3. Check CloudFront distribution status
4. Verify API endpoints are accessible
5. Review browser console for client-side errors
