    "# Holistic Packet Classification with IDP Common Package\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the holistic packet classification capability of the IDP Common Package to classify multi-document packets, where each document might span multiple pages. The holistic approach examines the document as a whole to identify boundaries between different document types within the packet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits of Holistic Packet Classification:**\n",
    "1. Properly handles multi-page documents within a packet\n",
    "2. Detects logical document boundaries\n",
    "3. Identifies document types in context of the whole document\n",
    "4. Handles documents where individual pages may not be clearly classifiable on their own\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates how to process a document with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. OCR Service - Convert a PDF document to text using AWS Textract\n",
    "2. Classification Service - Classify document pages into sections using Bedrock using the multi-model page based method.\n",
    "3. Extraction Service - Extract structured information from sections using Bedrock\n",
    "4. Evaluation Service - Evaluate accuracy of extracted information\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step uses the unified Document object model for data flow and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: This notebook uses AWS services including S3, Textract, and Bedrock. You need valid AWS credentials with appropriate permissions to run this notebook."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the end-to-end processing flow using AWS services and the unified Document model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Creation** - Initialize a Document object with input/output locations\n",
    "2. **OCR Processing** - Convert PDF to text using AWS Textract via OcrService\n",
    "3. **Classification** - Identify document types and sections with Claude via ClassificationService\n",
    "4. **Extraction** - Extract structured information with Claude via ExtractionService\n",
    "5. **Evaluation** - Compare extraction results against expected values and generate metrics\n",
    "6. **Document Model** - Document object is consistently used between all services\n",
    "7. **Result Storage** - Extraction results are stored in S3 with URIs tracked in the Document\n",
    "\n",
    "Key benefits of this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity** - Each service has a clear responsibility\n",
    "2. **Consistency** - Same data model flows through the entire pipeline\n",
    "3. **Performance** - Focused document pattern reduces resource usage\n",
    "4. **Flexibility** - Support for multiple backends (Bedrock, SageMaker)\n",
    "5. **Maintainability** - Standardized patterns across services\n",
    "6. **Measurement** - Built-in evaluation capabilities to measure accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses a  workflow with:\n",
    "1. S3 buckets (created specifically for this demo)\n",
    "2. AWS Textract OCR processing\n",
    "3. LLM inferencing via Bedrock\n",
    "4. A document sample (rvl_cdip_package.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Evaluation Service specifically provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiple evaluation methods (EXACT, NUMERIC_EXACT, FUZZY)\n",
    "2. Per-attribute and document-level metrics\n",
    "3. Markdown and JSON format reporting\n",
    "4. Integration with the Document model\n",
    "5. Configuration-driven evaluation methods"
