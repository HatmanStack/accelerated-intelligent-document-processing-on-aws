    "# Document Summarization with IDP Common Package\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the document summarization capability of the IDP Common Package to generate concise summaries of documents. The summarization service uses LLMs to analyze document content and produce both brief and detailed summaries, along with a formatted markdown report.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits of Document Summarization:**\n",
    "1. Quickly understand the main points of lengthy documents\n",
    "2. Extract essential information without reading the entire document\n",
    "3. Generate consistent summaries across different document types\n",
    "4. Preserve important facts while reducing document length\n",
    "5. Create shareable summary reports in markdown format\n",
