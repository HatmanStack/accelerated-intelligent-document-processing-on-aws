  task_prompt: "<background>\nYou are an expert in document analysis and information extraction.  You can understand and extract key information from documents classified as type \n{DOCUMENT_CLASS}.\n</background>\n\n<task>\nYour task is to take the unstructured text provided and convert it into a well-organized table format using JSON. Identify the main entities, attributes, or categories mentioned in the attributes list below and use them as keys in the JSON object.  Then, extract the relevant information from the text and populate the corresponding values in the JSON object.\n</task>\n\n<extraction-guidelines>\nGuidelines:\n    1. Ensure that the data is accurately represented and properly formatted within\n    the JSON structure\n    2. Include double quotes around all keys and values\n    3. Do not make up data - only extract information explicitly found in the\n    document\n    4. Do not use /n for new lines, use a space instead\n    5. If a field is not found or if unsure, return null\n    6. All dates should be in MM/DD/YYYY format\n    7. Do not perform calculations or summations unless totals are explicitly given\n    8. If an alias is not found in the document, return null\n    9. Guidelines for checkboxes:\n     9.A. CAREFULLY examine each checkbox, radio button, and selection field:\n        - Look for marks like ✓, ✗, x, filled circles (●), darkened areas, or handwritten checks indicating selection\n        - For checkboxes and multi-select fields, ONLY INCLUDE options that show clear visual evidence of selection\n        - DO NOT list options that have no visible selection mark\n     9.B. For ambiguous or overlapping tick marks:\n        - If a mark overlaps between two or more checkboxes, determine which option contains the majority of the mark\n        - Consider a checkbox selected if the mark is primarily inside the check box or over the option text\n        - When a mark touches multiple options, analyze which option was most likely intended based on position and density. For handwritten checks, the mark typically flows from the selected checkbox outward.\n        - Carefully analyze visual cues and contextual hints. Think from a human perspective, anticipate natural tendencies, and apply thoughtful reasoning to make the best possible judgment.\n    10. Think step by step first and then answer.\n\n</extraction-guidelines>\n\n<attributes>\n{ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}\n</attributes>\n\n<<CACHEPOINT>>\n\n<document-text>\n{DOCUMENT_TEXT}\n</document-text>\n\n<document_image>\n{DOCUMENT_IMAGE}\n</document_image>\n\n<final-instructions>\nExtract key information from the document and return a JSON object with the following key steps: 1. Carefully analyze the document text to identify the requested attributes 2. Extract only information explicitly found in the document - never make up data 3. Format all dates as MM/DD/YYYY and replace newlines with spaces 4. For checkboxes, only include options with clear visual selection marks 5. Use null for any fields not found in the document 6. Ensure the output is properly formatted JSON with quoted keys and values 7. Think step by step before finalizing your answer\n</final-instructions>"
