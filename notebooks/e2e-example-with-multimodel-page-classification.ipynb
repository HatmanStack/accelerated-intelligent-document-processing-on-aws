    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the end-to-end processing flow using real AWS services and the unified Document model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Creation** - Initialize a Document object with input/output locations\n",
    "2. **OCR Processing** - Convert PDF to text using AWS Textract via OcrService\n",
    "3. **Classification** - Identify document types and sections with Claude via ClassificationService\n",
    "4. **Extraction** - Extract structured information with Claude via ExtractionService\n",
    "5. **Document Model** - Document object is consistently used between all services\n",
    "6. **Result Storage** - Extraction results are stored in S3 with URIs tracked in the Document\n",
    "\n",
    "Key benefits of this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity** - Each service has a clear responsibility\n",
    "2. **Consistency** - Same data model flows through the entire pipeline\n",
    "3. **Performance** - Focused document pattern reduces resource usage\n",
    "4. **Flexibility** - Support for multiple backends (Bedrock, SageMaker)\n",
    "5. **Maintainability** - Standardized patterns across services\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses a real workflow with:\n",
    "1. Real S3 buckets (created specifically for this demo)\n",
    "2. Real AWS Textract OCR processing\n",
    "3. Real Claude 3 Sonnet inferencing via Bedrock\n",
