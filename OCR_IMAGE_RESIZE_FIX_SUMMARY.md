# OCR Image Resize Fix Summary

## Problem
The OCR service was incorrectly downsizing high-resolution images (PNG/JPG) when processing them, even when the resize configuration had empty values or when the image already fit within the specified dimensions.

## Root Cause
1. PyMuPDF was loading images at a lower resolution by default (converting pixels to points at 72 DPI)
2. The code was trying to compensate with zoom factors, but this was causing unintended resizing
3. The original file content wasn't being preserved when no resizing was needed

## Solution
Modified the OCR service to:
1. Pass the original file content directly when processing image files (not PDFs)
2. Use the original image data without PyMuPDF processing when:
   - No resize config is provided
   - Resize config has empty values
   - Image already fits within the specified dimensions
3. Only apply resizing when actually needed (image exceeds target dimensions)

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `_process_single_page` method
- Added `original_file_content` parameter
- Pass original content for image files to avoid PyMuPDF processing

### 2. Updated `process_document` method  
- Pass original file content when processing image files

### 3. Updated `_process_image_file_direct` method
- Added logic to use original file content directly when available
- Check if resizing is actually needed before applying it
- Preserve original image format and quality when no resize is needed

### 4. Removed problematic zoom factor logic
- Eliminated the complex zoom factor calculations that were causing issues
- Simplified the fallback logic for when original content isn't available

## Test Results

### Test 1: Empty resize config
- **Input**: 1913x2475 PNG image with empty resize config
- **Expected**: 1913x2475 (no resize)
- **Result**: ✓ PASS - Image dimensions preserved correctly

### Test 2: Valid resize config
- **Input**: 1913x2475 PNG image with target 951x1268
- **Expected**: 951x1230 (maintaining aspect ratio)
- **Result**: ✓ PASS - Image resized correctly to fit target bounds

### Test 3: Image already fits
- **Input**: 800x1000 PNG image with target 951x1268
- **Expected**: 800x1000 (no resize needed)
- **Result**: ✓ PASS - Image not resized since it already fits

## Benefits
1. **Performance**: Avoids unnecessary image processing when resize isn't needed
2. **Quality**: Preserves original image quality and format
3. **Efficiency**: Reduces processing time and resource usage
4. **Correctness**: Properly handles all resize configuration scenarios
